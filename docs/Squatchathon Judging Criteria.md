## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't overcomplicate** - 8 hours is short, focus on working features
2. **Don't skip mobile testing** - Open DevTools and check mobile view
3. **Don't forget the README** - Claude needs instructions to run your code
4. **Don't hardcode everything** - Use the sample data arrays
5. **Don't skip the brand colors** - Pink and blue are required

---

## üí° Quick Win Strategies

1. **Use CSS Grid/Flexbox** - Faster than positioning everything manually
2. **Copy the provided CSS** - Don't waste time writing from scratch
3. **Single Page App** - Avoid complex routing, use sections
4. **Focus on Flow** - Make sure booking works before adding extras
5. **Test Often** - Check your work every 30 minutes

---

## üì§ Submission Requirements

### Your GitHub repository must include:

1. **All source code** pushed to main branch
2. **README.md** with run instructions
3. **No node_modules** folder (add .gitignore)
4. **Final commit** before deadline

### Repository Naming Convention:
```
pink-blueberry-[teamname]
Example: pink-blueberry-teamawesome
```

### Submission Form Fields:
- GitHub Repository URL
- Team Name
- Team Members
- Any special run instructions

---

## üèÜ Winning Strategy

**Focus on these in order:**

1. ‚úÖ Get something working (even if ugly)
2. ‚úÖ Complete the booking flow
3. ‚úÖ Add brand colors
4. ‚úÖ Make it responsive
5. ‚úÖ Polish and add bonuses

**Remember:** A working ugly app beats a beautiful broken app!

## üÜò Quick Help

### If booking flow seems complex:
```javascript
// Simple state management
let booking = {
  service: null,
  stylist: null,
  date: null,
  time: null,
  name: '',
  email: '',
  phone: ''
};

// Update booking
function selectService(serviceId) {
  booking.service = serviceId;
  showNextStep();
}
```

### If responsive design is confusing:
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
.container {
  padding: 16px;
  max-width: 100%;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 768px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

## üéâ Good Luck!

**Remember:** Claude will judge based on working features, clean code, and proper use of brand colors. Focus on delivering a complete, functional booking system rather than perfect but incomplete features.

**Deadline:** [Insert exact time]  
**Submission:** [Insert submission link/form]
